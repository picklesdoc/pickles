### Showing basic gherkin syntax

In order to see that gherkin is a very simple language  

As a SpecFlow evangelist  

I want to show that basic syntax



![Test Image](test.jpg)

#### Scenario: Simple GWT
>
> **Given** the initial state of the application is Running
>
> **When** I ask what the application state is
>
> **Then** I should see Running as the answer
>
#### Scenario: Using And and But
>
> **Given** the initial state of the application is Running
>
> **And** I have authorization to ask application state
>
> **When** I ask what the application state is
>
> **Then** I should see Running as the answer
>
> **And** I should see the time of the application
>
> **But** the state of the application should not be Stopped
>

### The test runner is not (very) important

In order to show that the test runner is just for the autogenerated stuff in SpecFlow  

As a SpecFlow evanglist  

I want to be able to call my steps in the same manner inspite of the testrunner configured

#### Scenario: A couple of simple steps
>
> **Given** I have step defintions in place
>
> **When** I call a step
>
> **Then** the step should have been called
>

### Addition

As a SpecFlow evanglist  

I wan to  be able to hook into pre and post conditions in SpecFlow

#### Scenario: Hooking into pre conditions for Test Runs in SpecFlow
>
> **Given** the scenario is running
>
> **Then** the BeforeTestRun hook should have been executed
>
#### Scenario: Hooking into pre conditions for Features in SpecFlow
>
> **Given** the scenario is running
>
> **Then** the BeforeFeature hook should have been executed
>
#### Scenario: Hooking into pre conditions for Scenarios in SpecFlow
>
> **Given** the scenario is running

>
> **And** the missing step definitions are not reported
>
#### Scenario: A scenario without tags
>
> **Given** that my scenario has 0 tags
>
> **When** I run the scenario
>
> **Then** before scenario hook with '' is run
>
*`@testTag1`*

#### Scenario: A scenario with 1 tag
>
> **Given** that my scenario has 1 tags
>
> **When** I run the scenario
>
> **Then** before scenario hook with 'testTag1' is run
>
*`@testTag1`* *`@testTag2`* *`@testTag3`*

#### Scenario: A scenario with 3 tags
>
> **Given** that my scenario has 3 tags
>
> **When** I run the scenario
>
> **Then** before scenario hook with 'testTag1, testTag2, testTag3' is run
>
*`@testTag1`* *`@testTag3`*

#### Scenario: A scenario with 2 tags

### Injecting context into step specifications

In order to don't have to rely on the global shared state

and to be able to define the contexts required for each scenario.  

As a SpecFlow Evanglist  

I would like to have the system automatically inject an instance of any class as

defined in the constructor of a step file

#### Scenario: Feature with no context

>

### Multiline Feature Example

In order capture this particular Gherkin feature  

As a Pickles contributer  

I want to demonstrate an example of using multiline text in a Scenario

*`@mytag`*

#### Scenario: Mutliline Output
>
> **Given** I have read in some text from the user
>
> **When** I process this input
>
> **Then** the result will be saved to the multiline text data store
